# Gosl. fun. Special functions, DFT, FFT, Bessel, elliptical integrals, orthogonal polynomials, interpolators

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/cpmech/gosl/fun?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/cpmech/gosl/fun) 

More information is available in **[the documentation of this package](https://godoc.org/github.com/cpmech/gosl/fun).**

This package implements _special_ functions such as orthogonal polynomials and elliptical functions
of first, second and third kind.

Routines to interpolate and/or assist on spectral methods are also available; e.g. FourierInterp,
ChebyInterp.
